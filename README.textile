h3. logcanary README
logcanary is a very simple script for monitoring log files. It started life in one of my client websites, where all errors were written to a central logfile. I wanted to be able to poll that file and be notified by email when new lines were added. So I wrote logcanary.

logcanary is designed to run from your @crontab@. When executed against a logfile, it MD5-sums that file and writes the result to a separate text file. When run again, it re-sums the log file, and if the contents have changed, it generates an email containing the last n lines of the log.

Feel free to use and modify logcanary in any way you see fit. It'll likely be a little messy as I clean up the original files. I'll branch a 0.1 release when I'm satisfied that it's presentable :).

Enjoy!
